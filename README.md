# TIC-TAC-TOE-Game

## Description
This is a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete by taking turns placing their respective marks (X and O) in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three of the same marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

- **Reset and New Game**: Options to reset or start a new game without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. Players take turns clicking on the boxes in the grid.
2. Player O always starts the game.
3. The game checks for a winning pattern after every move.
4. If a player matches a winning pattern, they are declared the winner.
5. If all boxes are filled and no player wins, the game is declared a draw.
6. Players can reset the game or start a new round using the respective buttons.
